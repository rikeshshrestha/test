            following is the explanation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Fay">Hurricane Fay:</a>

            Hurricane Fay was the first hurricane to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987.[nb 1] The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser
            Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October
            11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear for most of its lifetime, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October
            12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October 13.

            A few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in anticipation of Fay's impact on Bermuda. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100 mph (155 km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility
            poles, and left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored
            and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200 Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane
            Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season

            Fay produced unexpectedly strong winds across Bermuda, especially over western and southern parts of the territory. L.F. Wade International Airport reported 10-minute sustained winds of 61 mph (98 km/h), with gusts to 82 mph (132 km/h). Several stations
            at higher elevations recorded gusts in excess of 115 mph (185 km/h), reaching 123 mph (198 km/h) at Commissioner's Point, about 150 ft (46 m) above sea level.[2] The most intense winds occurred in a relatively quick burst on the backside of
            the storm, within a large band of thunderstorms that affected the island a couple hours after the official landfall.[2][12] Local radar imagery indicated possible tornadic activity coinciding with the period of most damaging winds, though
            this could also have been an artifact of radar velocity folding.[14] A gauge at St. George's recorded a 1.78 ft (0.54 m) storm surge, though higher water rises may have affected the southern and western sides of the island.[2] Rainfall unofficially
            amounted to 3.70 in (94 mm) as reported by a member of the public, and the airport recorded 1.87 in (47 mm) of rain, though the observing equipment was compromised in both cases.[2] The hurricane brought down thousands of trees and tree limbs,
            making streets impassable.[14][15] The winds also toppled utility poles and inflicted roof damage on buildings.[11][16] Over 27,000 of the Bermuda Electric Light Company's 36,000 customers lost power at the height of the storm.[17] Several
            roads, including Front Street in Hamilton, were flooded.[11] Many boats up to 60 ft (18 m) in length broke free from their moorings and were damaged or destroyed upon being driven aground.[18] Hamilton city parks sustained considerable damage,
            and were closed due to safety hazards.[19] The combined effects of Fay and Gonzalo forced the Botanical Gardens and Arboretum to stay closed until mid-November, while cleanup of vegetation damage was underway.
